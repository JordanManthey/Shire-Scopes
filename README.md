# Shire-Scopes
Shire Scopes is a multiplayer FPS game I made with Unreal Engine 5.0 for PC. It's fully integrated with the Steam Online Subsystem and features matchmaking, custom lobbies, and friend invites. Supports both controller and mouse/keyboard. Available for free on Steam and Itch.io! 

This repository contains all of the C++ and blueprint files for this project. Most blueprints are uploaded to a visualization webtool [here](https://blueprintue.com/profile/jordanmanthey/), which allows you to see the top-level node layout of each blueprint.

I have also created a UML diagram to represent the system of relationships of all C++ and blueprints.

------------------

Prefixes used in blueprints:
BP = blueprint,
ABP = animation blueprint,
WBP = widget blueprint,
BTT = behavior tree task,
BTS = behavior tree service

*Note: BlueprintUE does not support Behavior Trees nor Animation Graphs. This is an unofficial tool and does not visualize everything perfectly.*
