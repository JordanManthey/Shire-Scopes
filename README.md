# Shire-Scopes
Shire Scopes is a multiplayer FPS game I made with Unreal Engine 5 for PC. It's fully integrated with the Steam Online Subsystem with matchmaking and custom lobbies. Supports both controller and mouse/keyboard. Available for free on Steam and Itch.io! 

This repository contains all of the C++ and blueprint files for this project. Most blueprints are uploaded to a visualization webtool called [BlueprintUE](https://blueprintue.com/profile/jordanmanthey/), which allows you to see the surface-level structure of each blueprint. Any blueprints not seen in BlueprintUE were either empty or trivial in functionality. 

I have also created a UML diagram to visually represent the system of relationships of all C++ and blueprints.

Prefixes used in blueprints:
BP = blueprint,
ABP = animation blueprint,
WBP = widget blueprint,
BTT = behavior tree task,
BTS = behavior tree service

*Note: BlueprintUE does not support Behavior Trees nor Animation Graphs. This is an unofficial tool and does not visualize everything perfectly.*
