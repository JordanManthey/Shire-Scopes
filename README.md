# Shire-Scopes
Shire Scopes is a quirky multiplayer arena shooter game I made with Unreal Engine 5. It's fully integrated with the Steam Online Subsystem and features matchmaking, custom lobbies, and friends. This repository contains all C++ code and Blueprints. Please refer to the README for blueprint visualizations.
